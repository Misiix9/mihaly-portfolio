# Refunds & Cancellations

## Deposits
- Deposits secure scheduling and are typically non‑refundable once work starts.

## Cancellations
- If the client cancels before start, deposit may be partially refundable (case‑by‑case).
- If cancelled after work begins, fees for work completed are due.

## Post‑Delivery
- Services are non‑returnable; issues are handled via the warranty/support provisions in the Terms of Service.

## How To Request
- Email hi@selora.dev with your project reference and details.
